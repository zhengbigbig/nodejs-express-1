# passport-jirengu


## Install

```bash
$ npm install passport-jirengu
```

## Usage

#### Create an Application

Before using `passport-jirengu`, you must register an application with Jirengu.
If you have not already done so, a new application can be created at
[developer applications](http://user.jirengu.com/oauth/applications) within
Jirengu's settings panel.  Your application will be issued a client ID and client
secret, which need to be provided to the strategy.  You will also need to
configure a callback URL which matches the route in your application.

#### Configure Strategy

The Jirengu authentication strategy authenticates users using a Jirengu account
and OAuth 2.0 tokens.  The client ID and secret obtained when creating an
application are supplied as options when creating the strategy.  The strategy
also requires a `verify` callback, which receives the access token and optional
refresh token, as well as `profile` which contains the authenticated user's
Jirengu profile.  The `verify` callback must call `cb` providing a user to
complete authentication.

```js
var JirenguStrategy = require('passport-jirengu').Strategy;

passport.use(new JirenguStrategy({
    clientID: JIRENGU_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: JIRENGU_CLIENT_SECRET,
    callbackURL: "http://127.0.0.1:3000/auth/jirengu/callback"
  },
  function(accessToken, refreshToken, profile, cb) {
    User.findOrCreate({ jirenguId: profile.id }, function (err, user) {
      return cb(err, user);
    });
  }
));
```

#### Authenticate Requests

Use `passport.authenticate()`, specifying the `'jirengu'` strategy, to
authenticate requests.

For example, as route middleware in an [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
application:

```js
app.get('/auth/jirengu',
  passport.authenticate('jirengu'));

app.get('/auth/jirengu/callback', 
  passport.authenticate('jirengu', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
  function(req, res) {
    // Successful authentication, redirect home.
    res.redirect('/');
  });
```
